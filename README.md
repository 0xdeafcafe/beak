Beak is a simple, extensible, and powerful API creation and management tool. Built using Electron, React, and Redux but striving for native levels of performance.

Beak includes:
- Powerful feature set for creating APIs interactions
- Variables, which allow you to use dynamic values in requests
- Variable Sets, which allow you to group variables together and easily switch between sets
- An extensions API to create custom Beak Variables
- Un-opinionated project syncing, just use the version control of your choice
- Beautiful design language
- And of course, fully cross platform
